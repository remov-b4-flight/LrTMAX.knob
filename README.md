# LrTMAX.knob
FreeCAD project Small knob for D-type volumes / rotary encoders.  
For space saving and Usability, LrTMAX makes own knobs.  
It maches 10~12mm height(from botton to top of encoder) and  
"D type axis" (NOT knewled,plum)  
Normally use "KNOB12.FCSrd" for manufacture, 12 knobs composited in one file.  
But some 3D printing service prohibit multiple parts par one STL file.  
so please use "KNOB1.FCStd".
