# LrTMAX.knob
FreeCAD project Small knob for D-type volumes / rotary encoders.  
For space saving and Usability, LrTMAX makes own knobs.  
It matches 10~12mm height(from bottom to top of encoder) and  
"D type axis" (NOT knewled,NOT plum)  
Normally use "KNOB12.FCSrd" for manufacture, 12 knobs composited in one file.  
But some 3D printing service prohibit multiple parts in one STL file.  
so please use "KNOB1.FCStd".
